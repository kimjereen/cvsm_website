                            The College of Veterinary Science and Medicine was founded in 1978 through the Republic Act No. 4067 which was enacted to law by Congress in 1964 and established through Board of Regent Resolution No. 17-78 s.1978. It was the first ladder-type veterinary curriculum in the country. During the years of implementation, students receive the Certificate in Animal Production after two years, the Bachelor of Science in Animal Husbandry after four years, and finally, the Doctor of Veterinary Science and Medicine degree after six years. This curricular program was designed by Dr. Teodulo M. Topacio for CVSM-CLSU under the leadership of the first Dean, Dr. Oscar D. Quines. In 2017, Dr. Topacio was conferred the honorific award of being the “Father of the CLSU College of Veterinary Science and Medicine”. The present curriculum only offered a straight DVM program since 2018.

                            Through the years, the college has transformed and transgressed into a level of distinction that sets it apart from other institutions. The outstanding performance of the CVSM, with the earned expertise in different areas of specialization of core faculty members, improvement of facilities and services, impressive performance in the licensure examination, various recognitions by national and international professional organizations, research completed, generation of technology and innovations, and linkages developed have placed the program in the forefront of excellence.
                            <br><br>
                            The DVM program applied for accreditation to the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines, Inc. (AACCUP) in 1997 for candidate status and since then has been elevated to higher levels in subsequent visits. Currently, the DVM program has Level IV Phase 1 re-accredited status until November 2020 and Level II Re-accredited status in the Master of Veterinary Studies program until October 2021.
                            <br><br>
                            On February 27, 2009, the Commission on Higher Education recognized the CLSU-College of Veterinary Science and Medicine as a Center of Excellence (COE) for the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program. The COE status has since been renewed every three years and maintained to this date. 
                            <br><br>
                            At present, the college has four departments, the Department of Animal Management, the Department of Morphophysiology and Pharmacology, the Department of Pathobiology, and the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences. 
                            <br><br>
                            In compliance with the minimum requirements set by the Commission on Higher Education, there is a Veterinary Teaching Hospital and Diagnostic Laboratory. The facility was established in 1985 as CLSU Veterinary Hospital, renamed CLSU Animal Medical Center in 1999, and with the Board of Regent's approval in February 2020 is now named as CLSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The facility serves as the final training ground for students where they can integrate and apply what they learned in the basic and core courses in animal and veterinary science.
                            <br><br>
                            The CVSM continues to uphold its core values of excellence and dedication towards its mission to produce veterinarians that are globally competent and service-oriented to contribute to animal health and food security fhrough countryside development.
